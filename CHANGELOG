29/3/09
Feature		Added the Object class 
				Objects don't move around the map and when animals try to move into their spot the object reacts (only works when invisible)
Feature		Added a new object to the game, Traps.
				Invisible to animals, kills the animal when it walks into it and it then renders the trap triggered and unusable

30/3/09
Feature		Added the start of disease in animals
				Still requires rates, the possibility of new colours, or offset colours to distinguish.
Fix			Wouldn't terminate if only traps remained
				Now, it terminates when all animals only are gone.
Feature		Added a GUI
				Only uses drop down menus, I tried with buttons but, it means the map has more limitations on its size.
Feature		Added the start of logging
				Added the barest of skeletons and setup a new format
					[Init]
					Rabbits: X Traps: X Foxes: X
					Rabbits: X Traps: X Foxes: X
					[Halt]
				(Order inside the tags changes due to an issue with HashMaps but it holds the same order for each log)
